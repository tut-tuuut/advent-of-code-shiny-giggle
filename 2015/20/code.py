# min value of gifts for house N  = 10 + N for houses which are prime numbers

# house 20:
# elf 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 stop by
# prime factors 2,2,5 => elves 2 and 5
# not prime factors 4, 10 : combinations of prime factors 2*2 and 2*5

# house 100:
# elves 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50
# prime factors 5 5 2 2
# snap, not a good example

# house 16
# elves 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
# prime factors 2 2 2 2
# combinations 2*2=4 2*2*2=8

# house 6
# elves 1, 2, 3, 6

# so maybe we can make a get_number_of_gifts which is not a O(n) ?
# with a result which could be
#      10 * (1 + N)
#      + something with unique prime factors < N
#      + something with combinations of prime factors with product < N

# house 8:
# elf 1, 2, 4,
